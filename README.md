# **R code for calculation of chances to win a playoff series using Monte Carlo simulation**

## Prerequisites

**First Round of NHL Playoff 2021**

**Teams: Minnesota Wild vs Vegas Golden Knights**

**Expert Forecast: Vegas wins the series 4:1**

**Let's go Wild! :-)**

### Project Objectives:
- [x] Build the matrix of all possible combinations of outcomes
- [x] Calculate the proportion of 'results' when the Wild wins the series
- [x] Perform the Monte Carlo simulation to confirm the results

### Technologies used:
```
R Studio
```

## How to use ##
1. Run the code. No specific libraries or packages required
2. Have fun!

## Results ##
1. Mathematical average prediction for the Wild to win the series - 0.34
2. Average prediction for the Wild to win the series under Monte Carlo simulation - 0.39
3. The real result - Knights won the series 4:3 :-(
